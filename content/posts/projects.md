## Autonomous Combat Robot

### August 2020 - May 2021

Inspired by the BattleBots competition, I joined a small team to create an autonomous 3lb combat
robot capable of competitively fighting a human controlled BattleBot. We built the system from
the ground up, setting our requirements and specifications, designing the hardware and software,
selecting the sensors, and integrating and testing. One of my primary contributions was to the
software controls system, which communicated with the vision system and onboard firmware via wifi
to send the robot movement commands. I also worked on the robot control GUI, which included an
E-STOP button as well as helpful features to aid the testing and debugging process. Throughout the
project, my teammates and I would meet regularly to integrate our subsystems and help each
other find solutions to problems we ran into along the way. In the end, our team accomplished all
our goals, and we successfully created a robot that could see its opponent and take appropriate
defensive countermeasures.

#### Skills I used: git, python, openCV, C++, object oriented design, model based systems engineering
