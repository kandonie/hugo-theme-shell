## Online Program Assistant, WPI Pre-Collegiate Summer Program

### June 2020 - August 2020

When WPI's summer program for high school students was made remote during the pandemic, I was eager
to participate as an Online Program Assistant. I took on two roles: tutoring students taking the
Intro to Robotics course; and serving as a community leader, planning events for the students to
socialize virtually and have some fun even in the early months of a scary pandemic. During our daily
zoom hangouts, we found creative ways to connect, from playing online games to agreeing beforehand
to each bring spatulas to the meeting for...no reason at all.

**Skills: {see Student Assistant skills above}, coming up with ways to make students laugh and connect**

## Campus Safety Transportation Program Driver, WPI Police

### September 2018 - November 2019

For this job, I took on one of three roles, depending on the shift: the dispatcher, who receives
phone calls from students requesting a ride; the calltaker, a passenger in the shuttle who gets
new ride requests from the dispatcher on radio; or the driver, who, well, drives the shuttle. My
favorite part of this job was getting to meet and work with so many different people. Since most
shifts involved being in the same vehicle with a coworker for several hours, I had a lot of fun
coming up with all sorts of conversation starters.

**Skills: expansive knowledge of streetnames, efficient mental route-planning,
ability to turn a "boring" graveyard shift into a really fun and memorable one**
