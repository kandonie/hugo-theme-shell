## Associate Member of the Engineering Staff, Lockheed Martin

### June 2021 - Present

At Lockheed Martin, I work on testing, developing, and maintaining a high-fidelity weapon controls
simulation for the US Navy's missile defense system. My work has included increasing automated tasks
in our daily software testing, investigating issues through root cause analysis, performing 
code reviews, and extending features to improve the simulation. I have gained experience using a
variety of Eclipse and commandline tools to navigate and debug a very large codebase with over
half a million lines of code. I have also worked on troubleshooting electrical hardware and identifying
the cause of circuit test failures.

**Skills: git, linux, gdb, C++, python, JIRA, Jenkins, Valgrind, Coverity, regression testing, Eclipse, circuit troubleshooting**

## Student Assistant, WPI Robotics Engineering Department

### October 2017 - May 2021

When I first took Intro to Robotics at WPI, I received so much support from the course staff, whether
it was help working through a difficult problem during office hours or a homemade cookie during a
stressful finals week. By the time I finished the course I wanted to join them in helping other
students, and a couple of weeks later I did! While at the time I wasn't much more experienced than
the students taking the class, I was committed to giving them a positive course experience.
They asked me tough questions during my office hours, and sometimes I didn't know the solution myself,
but I guided them based on the principles they learned in lecture and worked through the problem
together until they fully understood what was going on. Other times they would simply be frustrated
their robot wasn't doing what it was supposed to, so I showed them how to use oscilloscopes and
multimeters and helped them identify whether the problem was mechanical, electrical, or software.
Once we had narrowed down the possible causes of the issue, I helped them continue troubleshooting
until they fixed the issue.

**Skills: complex hardware-software debugging, C++, microcontrollers, electrical analysis, mechanical
analysis, teaching, supporting teams with varied interpersonal dynamics**

## Online Program Assistant, WPI Pre-Collegiate Summer Program

### June 2020 - August 2020

When WPI's summer program for high school students was made remote during the pandemic, I was eager
to participate as an Online Program Assistant. I took on two roles: tutoring students taking the
Intro to Robotics course; and serving as a community leader, planning events for the students to
socialize virtually and have some fun even in the early months of a scary pandemic. During our daily
zoom hangouts, we found creative ways to connect, from playing online games to agreeing beforehand
to each bring spatulas to the meeting for...no reason at all.

**Skills: {see Student Assistant skills above}, coming up with ways to make students laugh and connect**

## Campus Safety Transportation Program Driver, WPI Police

### September 2018 - November 2019

For this job, I took on one of three roles, depending on the shift: the dispatcher, who receives
phone calls from students requesting a ride; the calltaker, a passenger in the shuttle who gets
new ride requests from the dispatcher on radio; or the driver, who, well, drives the shuttle. My
favorite part of this job was getting to meet and work with so many different people. Since most
shifts involved being in the same vehicle with a coworker for several hours, I had a lot of fun
coming up with all sorts of conversation starters.

**Skills: expansive knowledge of streetnames, efficient mental route-planning,
ability to turn a "boring" graveyard shift into a really fun and memorable one**
