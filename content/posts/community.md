## Founder of the WPI Robotics Community Discord Server

In an effort to foster easier communication among robotics students, faculty, and staff at WPI,
I joined a small group of friends to organize and manage a server on Discord, an online chat
platform. We invited professors, department administrators, alumni, and students to join the
server and we created channels for different discussion topics. We collaborated with faculty and
staff members to ensure the server was a safe space and to offer our new tool to support course
communication and online campus events. Our server soon became a widely used space, where students
and faculty mingle to discuss everything from the latest academic colloquia to challenging
technical problems to the intrincacies of octopus behavior. It's turned into a place where members
of the robotics community turn to for help, for fun, and for feeling a little less alone during the
pandemic.

## Vice Chair of the Rho Beta Epsilon National Board

Rho Beta Epsilon is the Robotics Engineering Honor Society that was founded at WPI. After being
inducted as a member in the winter of 2019, I helped robotics students in the lab as part of
fulfilling my community service hours. A year later, I was elected Vice President of the chapter.
I worked on updating the bylaws to prepare the society for national accreditation, and I also planned
finals week events to help alleviate stress among students troubleshooting their final project
robots. Since these occurred during the pandemic, I came up with new ideas for virtual
events that would attract students without the usual promise of pizza. Upon my
graduation, I became the Vice Chair of the National Board, with the mission of expanding Rho Beta to
other universities with robotics programs.
