"Kristen is probably the coolest person I know. She courageously ventures into the unknown. Her constant
positivity and ability to evade the fear of failure constantly impress me, and lead her to achieving success.
She is a talented roboticist/computer scientist and possesses the impressive ability to impart that knowledge
unto others. Kristen is adventurous, smart, and compassionate. If I ran a business, she would be the first
person I hire. It has been a privilege and pleasure to know her through my time at college, and beyond."
