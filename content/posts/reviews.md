"No team member I worked with in college was more correlated to a project going smoothly than Kristen.
She was instrumental to leading an honor society through tumultuous times with the onset of COVID-19 and creating
an amazing online community of hundreds of robotics engineers from scratch. No matter what she was asked to do,
Kristen always rose to the challenge and delivered polished and professional results on time."

"I've worked on several projects with Kristen and having her on the team always helped. She learns quickly and always
gives everything she does 110%. In addition to her great work ethic and technical skills she is a good person who
gets along well with everyone."

"Kristen is probably the coolest person I know. She courageously ventures into the unknown. Her constant
positivity and ability to evade the fear of failure constantly impress me, and lead her to achieving success.
She is a talented roboticist/computer scientist and possesses the impressive ability to impart that knowledge
unto others. Kristen is adventurous, smart, and compassionate. If I ran a business, she would be the first
person I hire. It has been a privilege and pleasure to know her through my time at college, and beyond."

"From my experience working with Kristen, she is not only driven, persistent, and an excellent problem solver,
but she is also someone whose passion radiates at every step of the way."
